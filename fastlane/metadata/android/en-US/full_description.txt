We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
➜ Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
➜ Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
➜ Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
➜ On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.

<h1>👉 Our grades are science-based, and Open Food Facts is helping science!</h1>
➜ We don't make up things. We rely on peer-reviewed science.
➜ The Nutri-Score has been created by the independent French team led by Professor Hercberg.
➜ The NOVA groups on food processing have been designed by the international team of Professor Monteiro.
➜ The additives synthesis is based on reviews by EFSA on exposure levels on food additives.
➜ The Eco-Score is based on ground breaking data by ADEME, the French environmental agency, adapted for the world.
➜ The Open Food Facts community is collaborating with research teams across the planet for research that benefits all.
