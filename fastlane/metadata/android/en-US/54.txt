The Open Food Facts project turns 10 ! We've created a completely new version of the app to celebrate.
Many thanks to all contributors who have worked during 2 years on all those new features!

New features:
* All new design
* The product page is much more helpful
* Customize what you see when you scan a product
* Create personal lists of products

Open Food Facts is a non-profit project to open food data from around the world. Join us on https://en.openfoodfacts.org

Scan the barcode of food products to know which products are good for you (nutritional quality: Nutri-Score, NOVA group, additives and allergen alerts) and the planet (Eco-Score)!

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this update at contact@openfoodfacts.org
