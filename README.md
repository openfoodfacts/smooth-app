## Presentation

This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface.

Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API.
Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add Eco-Score support
- [ ] Add Fastlane publishing to the AppStore and the Play Store and GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add multilingual screenshot generation using Fastlane
- [ ] Fix navigation for the iOS build (iOS does not have a back button, and gestures are not intuitive for most people)
- [ ] Remove the hack on the category explorer
- [ ] User management + Small point system for contributions

## Building

In order to build the application, make sure you are in the packages/smooth_app directory and run these commands :
 - flutter pub get
 - flutter run
 
### Android
### iOS
We need to change the supported architectures for iOS when we open the project in Xcode. There, in the settings, you can specify which ones you want to build for, and only specify the ones that are 64 bit. After that it should build fine for the MLKit component.

## Internationalization

Translations of the interface are managed using the [Flutter Intl plugin / intl_utils Dart package](https://github.com/localizely/flutter-intl-plugin-sample-app) by localizely.
New strings need to be added to lib/l10n/intl_en.arb and the [corresponding translations can be added through CrowdIn](https://translate.openfoodfacts.org/translate/openfoodfacts/1322). Do not edit the other intl_*.arb files as they will be overwritten by CrowdIn.
.arb files generated from CrowdIn currently have a wrong locale set to "en", run the script ./fix_locale_of_arb_files.sh in the packages/smooth_app/lib/l10n directory to assign the right locale from the file names.

## Thank you
Smooth_app is made possible thanks to a grant by the Mozilla Foundation, after pitching them the idea at FOSDEM. a HUGE thank you :-)
