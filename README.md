## Current Release

- Latest commit deployed to Apple App Store: Released on Nov 29th as Build 835
- Latest commit deployed to PlayStore: 792 from Nov 6th 11AM

## Presentation

- This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface. It is a <b> Flutter application </b> by [Open Food Facts](https://github.com/openfoodfacts).
- We pioneered the collaborative scanning app in 2012. With this experimental app, we‚Äôre reinventing it from the ground up.
- Install it on **Android** ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/openfoodfacts.github.scrachx.openfood/) or [Amazon App Store](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Food-Facts-food-Nutriscore/dp/B00U49IVIU)) or [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/app/open-food-facts/id588797948). Note that a internal development build ([Android](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4699092342921529278) or **iPhone/iPad** ([App Store](https://testflight.apple.com/join/c2tiBHgd)) if you'd like to use the results of your PRs quicker.

- Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API and [openfoodfacts_flutter_lints](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts_flutter_lints) which provides specific linting
- Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.
- We support desktop platforms (Linux, macOS and Windows), but **only for development**

## How to run the project

- Make sure you have installed flutter and all the requirements
  - [Official flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Currently, the app uses the previous version of Flutter (3.10). We plan to migrate soon.


We have predefined run configurations for Android Studio and Visual Studio Code

In order to run the application, make sure you are in the `packages/smooth_app` directory and run these commands:

- `flutter pub get .`

- On Android ü§ñ: `flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/android/main_google_play.dart`

- On iOS/macOS üçé: `flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/ios/main_ios.dart`

- TroubleshootingüöÄ: If you get an error like `App depends on scanner shared from path which depends on camera_platform_interface from git, version solving failed.`  then run
  - `flutter pub cache clean` or manually delete  the  
  - `C:\Users\~\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache`  file.
 Then redo the above procedure to run the app.

<details><summary><h3>Thanks</h3></summary>
The app was initially created by Primael. The new Open Food Facts app (smooth_app) was then made possible thanks to an initial grant by the Mozilla Foundation in February 2020, after Pierre pitched them the idea at FOSDEM. A HUGE THANKS üß°
In addition to the core role of the community, we also had the support from several Google.org fellows and a ShareIt fellow that helped us eventually release the app in June 2022.
