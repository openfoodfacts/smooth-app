# Open Food Facts - Codename: "Smooth App"

A new Flutter application by Open Food Facts

## Presentation

This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface.

Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API.
Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.

## V1 Roadmap


## V2 - Later Roadmap
### Screenshot automation
- [ ] Add multilingual screenshot generation using Fastlane (Scan screen, settings screen, personalized ranking screen, home screen) - https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/217

### Navigation
- [ ] Fix navigation for the iOS build (iOS does not have a back button, and gestures are not intuitive for most people) - https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/17

### Debt removal
- [ ] Remove the hack on the category explorer - https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/19

### Personalized results
- [ ] Allow to filter results by country and by store https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/99

### Gamification
- [ ] User management + Small point system for contributions

### Product page

### Scanning
- [ ] Allow the user to find alternatives products on a scan even if (s)he has scanned only 1 product https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/23
- [ ] Add offline scanning to ensure results in all conditions https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/18

## Building

In order to build the application, make sure you are in the packages/smooth_app directory and run these commands :
 - flutter pub get
 - flutter run
 
### Android
- Nothing to report

### iOS
- [ ] We need to change the supported architectures for iOS when we open the project in Xcode. There, in the settings, you can specify which ones you want to build for, and only specify the ones that are 64 bit.
- [ ] Fastlane is failing

## Internationalization

Translations of the interface are managed using the new [Flutter internationalization](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-hungergames/blob/master/src/i18n/common.json) introduced in Flutter 1.22.
New strings need to be added to lib/l10n/app_en.arb and the [corresponding translations can be added through CrowdIn](https://translate.openfoodfacts.org/translate/openfoodfacts/1322). Do not edit the other app_*.arb files as they will be overwritten by CrowdIn.
