Smoothie. We pioneered the collaborative scanning app in 2012. With this experimental app, we’re reinventing it from the ground up, and this time, it’s personal.

## You get: 
- a scan that truly matches who you are (Green: the product matches your criteria, Red: there is a problem, Gray: Help us answer you by photographing the products)
- a product page that's knowledgeable, building on the vast amount of food facts we collect collaboratively, and other sources of knowledge, to help you make better food decisions
## You can: 
- scan and compare in 15 seconds the 3 brands of tomato sauces left on the shelf, on your terms.
- get a tailored comparison of any food category
- set your preferences without ruining your privacy

## Criteria you can pick: 
- Environment: Eco-Score
- Health: Additives & Ultra processed foods, Salt, Allergens, Nutri-Score

## Presentation

This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface.

Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API.
Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.

## V1 Roadmap (Shipped on June 15th 2022 for Vivatech)
- [x] We should be able to ship the Smoothie code to the main listing on Android and iOS
- [x] The app should be able to scan very well
- [x] Minimal Road to Scores (you should be able to get Nutri-Score and Eco-Score on any unknown/uncomplete product in 2 minutes, using editing and/or product addition
  - [x] Initial photo taking, good ingredient extraction, Nutrition input, Category input (TODO)
- [ ] Personalization system that does not feel weird during setup, where people understand consequence, and where ranking match their expectations even in stretch cases (lack of data on some product, selecting Nutri-Score and all Low-in Nutrients…), where red-lines are clearly shown (allergens) with potential caveats, where solutions are proposed and warning issued in case of lack of data.
- [x] Database migration for existing Android and iOS users (minimum: history, credentials, if possible with allergen alerts, lists)
- [x] A Welcome scan card that can broadcast a message from the Open Food Facts team per country/language (Tagline)
- [x] On-page photo refresh capabilities (Not working well)
- [ ] Revamped settings that are less cluttered, and can make way in the future for things the user will go see more often.
- [x] [V1 tracking](https://github.com/orgs/openfoodfacts/projects/7)

## V1.1 - Later Roadmap
- [ ] Speedup image upload
- [ ] Fix HTTP header and contribution comments
- [ ] Add power edit mode that concatenates all the editable things for faster contribution
- [ ] Add a list of things to do contribution wise on the product (via KP or natively)
- [ ] Clarify the alternative product proposition
- [ ] Allow to switch languages
- [ ] Allow to expand search results to the world
- [ ] Reintroduce the portion calculator

## V2 - Later Roadmap


### Gamification
- [ ] User management + Small point system for contributions

### Scanning
- [ ] [Add offline scanning to ensure results in all conditions](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/18)


### Screenshot automation (nice to have)
- [ ] [Add multilingual screenshot generation using Fastlane (Scan screen, settings screen, personalized ranking screen, home screen)](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/issues/217)

## Building

In order to build the application, make sure you are in the packages/smooth_app directory and run these commands :
 - flutter pub get
 - flutter run

### Dev Mode
- How to activate it: We now have a in-app dev mode which allows you to debug things faster, or access not-ready-for-primetime features. You can access it by going to Preferences screen > Contribute > Software Development, and then enabling Dev Mode.
- Feel free to file an issue if you'd like new switches in this dev mode.
- You can also add new flags for your features.
  - example: https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app/pull/834

## Internationalization

- Translations of the interface are managed using the new [Flutter internationalization](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-hungergames/blob/master/src/i18n/common.json) introduced in Flutter 1.22.
- New strings need to be added to lib/l10n/app_en.arb and the [corresponding translations can be added through CrowdIn](https://translate.openfoodfacts.org/translate/openfoodfacts/1322). Do not edit the other app_*.arb files as they will be overwritten by CrowdIn.
