# smooth_app

A new Flutter application by Open Food Facts

## Presentation

This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface.

*mockups coming soon*

Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API.
Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.

## Building

In order to build the application, *make sure you are in the packages/smooth_app* directory and run these commands :
 - flutter pub get
 - flutter run

If you get the error message:  
Because smooth_app depends on openfoodfacts from path which doesn't exist (could not find package openfoodfacts at "../../../openfoodfacts-dart"), version solving failed.
