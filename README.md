## Presentation

This new mobile application aims to showcase Open Food Facts's power to a broad range of users through a smooth user experience and sleek user interface.

<img alt="app showcase" height='175' src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1689815/168430524-3adc923a-1ce3-4233-9af5-02e9d49a76ca.png" align="left" hspace="1" vspace="1">

Smooth-app is developed in parallel to the [openfoodfacts-dart](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-dart) plugin, which provides a high level interface with the Open Food Facts API.
Every new interaction with the API should be implemented in the plugin in order to provide these new features to other developers.

<details><summary><h3>Thanks</h3></summary>
The app was initially created by Primael. The new Open Food Facts app (smooth_app) was then made possible thanks to an initial grant by the Mozilla Foundation in February 2020, after Pierre pitched them the idea at FOSDEM. A HUGE THANKS üß°
In addition to the core role of the community, we also had the support from several Google.org fellows and a ShareIt fellow that helped us eventually release the app in June 2022.
